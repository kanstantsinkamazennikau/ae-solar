In most countries around the world, especially in developing counties, the Christmas season is a period when our energy consumption is at an all-time high from bright lights to high electricity-consuming appliances that keeps running around the clock. It is well known that during the Christmas holidays a sharp rise in energy consumption, leading to higher emissions of CO2 can be seen there have been studies that even prove this.  In the US alone it was found that during this festive season energy consumption increased by 30 % due to the overuse of appliances and lights. According to the study done in 2008 using data from a 2008 US Department of Energy report and the World Bank, bright lights strung on American trees, rooftops and lawns account for 6.63 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity consumption every year which is a lot when compared to what most poor countries use in a year.

In general, energy bills are higher when there is higher demand but then during the holiday season, and it's also during wintertime so, utilities at houses work a little extra to keep the community bright. In some cases, simple energy-efficiency upgrades can even save homes as much energy as installing [solar panels](https://ae-solar.com/products-list/). So, energy efficiency is the key to ensuring a safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy system for the future. It is seen as key to resolving climate change and improving the lives of people and creating economic prosperity.  This can be achieved using solar energy.
