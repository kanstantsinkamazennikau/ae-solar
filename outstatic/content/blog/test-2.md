## **INTRODUCTION**

Solar modules work based on Photoelectric effect and in the simplest words, light energy conversion to electricity is photoelectric effect. There are different applications for photoelectric effect, but all are same basis.\
We want to take you back to school to teach you about the photoelectric effect in a practical way. Itâ€™s not rocket science! Basically, we will find atomic model of matter and we will see there are some tiny particles that their actions and reactions provide energy.

## **MATTER ATOMIC MODEL**

Basically, scientists try to explain nature phenomenon by pattern that could be repeated in many cases explanation. Science explain quality of phenomenon and answer first curious minds question as (how?) and then quantity of phenomenon by answering second question as (how much?). Therefore, scientific models through theories could be helpful because they can explain nature phenomenon repeatedly like urban rules and they are valuable how long they are working.\
\
There are three major scales in science that scientists are dealing with. Huge as stars, ordinary as common life and tiny as atoms. Unfortunately, there is not a unique theory for all of the scales explanation (however they are related together in many ways), then there are different theories in different scales. Now, tiny or atomic scale time.\
\
Democritus in ancient times describe the smallest portion of matter as Atom and he thought it is unit of matter like a brick as unit of building but more investigations in recent centuries showed something should be inside of the unit and then scientists tried to understand Atom system. In words, they understood Atom is a system that some particles inside are working together!\
\
Finally, they named major particles as Electron, Proton and Neutron. On the other hand, they found out Electron has negative and Proton has positive charge.
