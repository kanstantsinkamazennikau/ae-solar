The middle eastern energy market is strongly Oil dependent and they are making plans to have a strong incentive to diversify their economies and have all set ambitious renewable energy goals. Even though the industry experienced a slowdown during the global Covid-19 pandemic, solar energy is once again starting to gain momentum.  Photovoltaic solar energy has been growing at a significant rate and is expected to witness high growth in the forecast period and dominate the solar market in the middle east.

When it comes to the middle east, The UAE has been at the forefront of the clean energy transition in the Gulf region in terms of PV deployment and ambitious renewable targets. A trend for increasingly ambitious solar projects is being seen across the region in recent times. Backed up by large renewable energy targets, innovative research and development, and investments across the entire industry value chain, it is projected that UAE will reach 20GW from solar power by the year 2030. The UAE is aiming to increase the contribution of clean energy in its energy mix to 50% by 2050 where most of the activity is concentrated in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Four solar projects, which are all at various stages of development, are expected to drive this growth which is the Al Dhafra (2GW), Abu Dhabi PV3 (1.5GW), and the fourth (950MW) and fifth (900MW) phases of the (MBR) solar facility. The MBR plant is said to be the world’s largest single-site solar installation, with a planned total capacity of 5GW when fully operational by 2030.  The MBR solar park is planned in several phases Once fully complete, this mega solar park will reach 5 GW in capacity.

Turkey has a high potential for solar energy generation, especially in the Mediterranean provinces. Conditions for solar power generation are comparable to Spain. according to data compiled by Anadolu Agency (AA) in 2021. The share of Turkey’s solar power rose to 7.5% but it is still lower than the country’s untapped potential. Turkey added 658 MW of solar capacity this year, bringing the country's total solar power capacity to 7,325 MW which represents 14% of the total capacity of renewables. Turkey is trying to increase its output from renewables as the country is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels. Compared to other renewable resources such as hydropower and wind, solar is one of the newest energy sources in the country in terms of installations. Konya, an Anatolian province is a home to Turkey’s biggest solar power plant and it also has the highest solar capacity with 914 MW followed by Ankara, the capital with 390.9 MW of installed solar capacity, and followed by Sanliurfa with 379 MW. Although Turkey has a potential of 7.5 hours of sunshine daily its potential is relatively untapped nevertheless Turkey has strong motivation to ramp up its renewable energy efforts.
