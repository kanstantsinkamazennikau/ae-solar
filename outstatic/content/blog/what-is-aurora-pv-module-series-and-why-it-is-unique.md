AE Solar is a Tier 1 that designs and manufactures world-class products. Recently AE Solar has upgraded and rebranded modules under a new name [AURORA ](https://ae-solar.com/aurora-solar-module/)with three different categories. 

1. The Aurora Mono-facial
2. The Aurora Bifacial double-glass
3. The Aurora Bifacial glass-transparent backsheet. 

These panels are designed to be high efficiency, high reliability, and high durability. Mono-facial panels as the name suggests are PV modules that can generate energy from the sunny/front side of the module. Bifacial solar panels consist of solar cells which can generate power from both the front and rear sides While the mono-facial modules can collect the light only from the front side, the bifacial modules can benefit from reflected energy from the surroundings (Albedo) and increase the energy yield of the PV modules/systems.  Having a background with higher reflection properties (e.g. snow or concrete) leads to higher energy generation from the rear side which increases the system energy and reduces the levelized cost of energy. Bifacial PV modules with transparent backsheet benefit from lower weight, easier handling and lower relative costs compared to the glass-glass modules. However, the glass-glass modules benefit from superb durability, especially in extreme climates.

## **HIGH OUTPUT PERFORMANCE**

The Aurora solar panels are available in a wide range of power classes starting from 335W up to 665W. The efficiency ranges from 19.88% to 21.4%. High efficiency solar cells and optimized cell-to-module power ratio ensures higher output power and yield und different lighting conditions. The half-cut cell module design with series and parallel interconnection increases the module tolerance under partial shading conditions. The Aurora series are offered with different cell sizes of 166 mm, 182 mm and 210 mm which make the module a flexible choice for system designs by considering the module dimensions and rated electrical properties. The durable module design ensures the reliability of the PV modules and they are now offered with 15 years of product warranty and 30 years of performance warranty. Due to flexibility of Aurora series, they can be used in both residential and utility-scale applications.

## **TOUGH WEATHER**

The Standard Test Conditions are designed for moderate climates. However, new emerging markets in desert, tropical and arctic areas suffer from harsh environmental stress factors such as high UV doses, high-temperature variation between night and day, high ambient temperature, mechanical loads (wind or snow), and humidity. These environmental factors decrease the module lifetime and performance. Utilizing high-end components and modules with a different bills of materials make the Aurora series a perfect choice for different climate conditions. The versatility of Aurora modules makes it possible to choose the module not only based on system design but also the environmental conditions. As an example, the glass-glass modules with half-cut cells and POE encapsulation materials ensure the lowest UV degradation, thermal-cycling losses, mechanical loads and humidity losses which makes it the most durable module in desert and tropical climates.

## **VERY LOW – LIGHT-INDUCED DEGRADATION**

The PV industry has witnessed a rapid use of gallium-doped silicon. Gallium-doped silicon demonstrates a very high lifetime and stability during illumination. Gallium-doped silicon wafers effectively mitigate light-induced degradation compared to using boron-doped solar cells. The average gallium-doped efficiency is 0.09 % higher than the boron-doped cells. Gallium-doped PV modules can offer long-term performance, stability, and potentially improved return on investment (ROI).

## **WARRANTY**

For solar panels product warranty usually covers a shorter period frame when compared to a performance warranty. Performance warranty states solar panels generate 80 – 90%of power over years. Product warranty on the other hand is based on the materials and quality. The enables customers to point out the damages and defects in the panel itself and also if it’s working or not. Generally, solar companies offer 12 years of product warranty and 25-year performance warranty. Aurora solar panels offer 15 years of product warranty and 30 years of performance warranty.

## **PV MODULE TESTING AND CERTIFICATIONS**

Success in the solar industry starts with testing and certification. PV modules must be safe and durable, ensuring the system’s high yield over the long term, and still need to be commercially viable. AE Solar’s Aurora panels are certified according to international standards. Which includes IEC 61215 and 61730, IEC62716 (Ammonia resistant), IEC 61701 (Salt mist corrosion resistant), IEC 60068 (Sand and dust resistant), and also IEC 62804 (Potential induced degradation). The certifications include the TÜV Rhineland test mark and also ISO certification.
