As the demand for sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions continues to grow, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have emerged as a prominent option for both residential and commercial applications. Grid-tied systems are connected to the grid and can interact with it to sell excess power back to the utility company or draw power from the grid when needed. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process involved in generating electricity from grid-tied PV systems.\

The process of grid-connected PV systems can be broken down into the following key steps:

1.  Solar Energy Conversion

   The first step in the process involves the conversion of sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity by the solar panels. This is achieved through the use of photovoltaic cells, which directly convert solar radiation into electrical energy.
2. Inversion of Electricity

   The generated DC electricity is then fed into an inverter, where it is converted into alternating current (AC) electricity. This conversion is essential as most electrical appliances and the grid itself operate on AC power.
