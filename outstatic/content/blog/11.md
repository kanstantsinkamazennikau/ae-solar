IMAR is the second-largest province in China,with the technical development potential of solar energy resources is 9.4 billion kilowatts, and accounting for approximately 21% of China's total. With an annual sunshine duration of 2600-3200 hours, it is an ideal location for pioneering clean energy initiatives. AE Solar, a global leader in photovoltaic technology and solar solutions, has established its foothold in this region with a venture that promotes sustainable energy and encompasses six distinctive rooftop installations within the Jalaid Banner region, located in the eastern part of IMAR, effectively harnessing the power of the sun to reduce carbon footprints and meet growing energy demands.

Introducing the Jalaid Banner Rooftop installations in detail:\
\
Jubao PV Power Station\
Capacity: 5999 kWp\
Longding PV Power Station\
Capacity: 4715.7 kWp\
Jinhe PV Power Station\
Capacity: 4699.2 kWp\
Nutuke PV Power Station\
Capacity: 2140.6 kWp\
Jinrui PV Power Station\
Capacity: 1778.7 kWp\
Hundahan PV Power Station\
Capacity: 1526.8 kWp\
\
The combined capacity of these installations is 20.86 megawatts peak (MWp), however, the significance of this project goes beyond numbers and figures. It's about the tangible impact it makes on the local community. This project addresses not only the growing energy demands but also making a substantial impact on the local energy landscape while contributing to the broader objectives of China's green energy transition.

### **The 'Solar +' Initiative**

\
The Jalaid Banner Rooftop Distributed PV Project exemplifies the 'Solar +' concept, capitalizes on existing building rooftops, including government facilities, schools, hospitals, village committees, industrial sites, and rural residences, covering approximately 200,000 square meters. This initiative is expected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 508,000 tons. It demonstrates the potential of sustainable energy to coexist with green development in terms of improving communities, generating income, and enhancing the quality of[ life.](http://life.As)\
\
As we move forward, this project highlights not only the role of sustainable energy in environmental conservation but also its ability to empower local communities and stimulate regional economies. Itâ€™s is not just about reducing carbon footprints; it's about illuminating lives, igniting economies, and fostering a brighter and more sustainable future for Inner Mongolia.
