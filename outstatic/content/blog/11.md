Renewable energy has emerged as a key driver of global employment growth, with the solar photovoltaic (PV) sector leading the way. The [solar PV](https://ae-solar.com/ourstory/) industry has experienced remarkable expansion, surpassing 3.9 million jobs worldwide in 2022, representing a 13% increase from the previous year. This growth trend underscores the significant role that solar power plays in the global transition towards clean and sustainable energy sources.

Solar PV installation has been the primary focus of employment growth within the sector. Two-thirds of PV jobs are associated with installing new solar capacity. This highlights the increasing demand for solar installations across various sectors and regions.

Manufacturing of solar PV components also plays a significant role in employment within the sector. Approximately 20% of total employment is dedicated to the manufacturing of polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, and inverters. China leads the way in solar PV manufacturing, accounting for over 75% of manufacturing-related jobs.

The growth of solar PV employment is not limited to any specific region. However, China has emerged as key players in the solar industry with over half a million PV jobs, leads the pack, followed by Europe, India, North America, Central and South America, Africa, and the rest of the world.

The positive employment trends in the solar PV sector are indicative of a bright future for the renewable industry as a whole. As countries strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning to clean and sustainable energy sources. This transition not only helps mitigate environmental challenges but also creates significant job opportunities and economic growth.

In addition to solar PV, other renewable sectors have also witnessed notable employment growth. The electric vehicle (EV) and battery sector experienced a remarkable 148% increase in employment from 2019 to 2022. Wind energy, critical minerals, and heat pumps have also seen positive employment trends, indicating a diverse and thriving renewable industry.

The growth in renewable energy employment is a testament to the increasing recognition of the economic potential and environmental benefits associated with clean energy technologies. Governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide are embracing renewables as a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

As we look ahead, it is clear that the renewable industry holds immense promise for job creation and economic prosperity. The data on global employment growth in the renewable industry paints a picture of a bright future ahead. With continued investments, supportive policies, and technological advancements, we can expect further expansion in renewable energy employment opportunities.
